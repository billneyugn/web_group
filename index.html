                <p>Like spreading butter on a toast, our group's collaboration on the assignment was very smooth. We all had different strengths and weaknesses, but we finished this assignment without incident. We assigned tasks so that everyone could contribute. The boys work together to complete the assignment on time. We communicated frequently to keep each other updated on our progress. We also had a few meetings to talk about our plans and make sure everyone was on the same page. Overall, I believe we worked well together and did our best in such a short amount of time for this assignment.

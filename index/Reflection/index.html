    <p>The development of the group website and a prototype of our culinary recipe website. We created The Multiverse of Cooking apps with the intentions of keeping the authenticity of a dish.
    </p>
    <p>We collaborated effectively. We all recognized and capitalized on each other's strengths and weaknesses. The simplest thing we did was hand out directions and perform HTML while having fun identifying the food sources. Doing the CSS stuff was the most frustrating and discouraging thing. It was a pain in the throat because we had no prior experience with CSS. It took so long to understand the fundamentals that it took a full day.
    </p>
    <p>We had overlooked the assignment's complexities as a team. This leads to poor time management and the situation "We need more time!" The fact that not a single person on our team knows how to utilize Figma, the technology used to create our prototype food recipe website and mobile app has surprised and shocked us. But at the end we push through and we all get a good night's sleep.
    </p>
    <p>We could and must improve in a few areas in future initiatives. The first thing that needs to be improved is our communication. During the assignment, we did have regular meetings and sent many text messages. However, there were a few times when members missed important information, which led to a misunderstanding and wasted a lot of time. To fix this, Constance will make sure to inform members every hour on how the task is progressing. The second area for improvement is our understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and FIGMA because are lack of knowledge during the process of doing the project there are lots of setback for our team so in-order to grow is to not rushing into the task and spend more Time identifies the things we need to study.The third things for us to improve in the future is to look deeper, at the end of the project it is obvious that things are not going as smoothly as they would have we all let the fact that we work well together blinded us and now we are unhappy with our outcome. 
    </p>
    <p>Overall, this project not only brings us more knowledge and skills about coding and website but this project also makes us understand the importance of working in a team, a team is more than the sum of its individual members. Identifying and combining our contacts and abilities to create something more potent than any of us alone was essential to what we achieved.

        Wrapping up my first IT project and my first semester at RMIT university, I just wanted to say that this project had enlightened my soul that working in a team is not that bad. Every member of my team is really friendly and we cooperate very well together. But there are still things for me to improve, the number one thing on my list to improve right now is my experience and knowledge about coding. I couldn't be much help to the other three members because I am a slow learner so basically my coding skills are horrible at the moment. There is one thing that surprised me in this project is how much pressure it put on me but it is a good thing because when I endure great pressure I can become a diamond. Another thing that I notice when working with this team is that there is barely any conflict among members. I think it is because we all are freshmen and they know that not everybody is a fast learner. To sum up, I am really pleased and grateful with this team and this project since I could and have learned a lot about coding and how to work on a team.

        Generally speaking, after this project, I think I have learned more coding editor and even UX/UI editors like Figma to present the appearance of our app and website. I think our web developing and mobile app designing process has run quite well and smoothly. Surprisingly, although none of the members in our team know how to design an app, we can successfully design a mobile app prototype by using Figma. After finishing our assignment, I have learned a lot of things from my group, especially punctuality. Despite not having a specific deadline for each member, our members were always trying to finish their task as soon as possible and that is what I am proud of the most of my team. However, we need to improve the skills of using more features of Figma to make the prototype less time-consuming and Github is what we have to practice more to get used to as we still had a difficult time with some git commands to commit our work to our repository. Moreover, HTML and CSS will require us to have advanced skills to complete the whole website. On the other hand, to develop a mobile app, we have to learn Swift and IDE for IOS and Android.

        As a team leader, I found out that I have a lot to learn and received a lot of insight from my teammates to reflect myself. I personally think that we did quite well in team working. We did not have as much conflict as I imagined.I was able to finalize and visualize a mutual path for our team to follow. And the proudest thing I did was to be able to keep my team to follow that mutual path successfully. In contrast to that, due to the lack of knowledge in IT, I wasn't able to give and determine the suitable deadlines for our tasks. It was too tight for us so we did have to extend and delay a few of our deadlines. It did leave a few uncomfort to my teammate cuz they could not finish the deadlines on time. And I think this could be improved by micro-managing my teammate a little bit more so that we could extend the time as soon as a signal of rushing appeared to relieve a bit more stress on my teammates. Another thing is that I was surprised that conflict and miss communication could be solved as quickly and as peacefully as possible by just asking others to clarify even the smallest wonder. No one is gonna judge you because we all start from somewhere and it is understandable to have silly questions. Overall, I am really happy about the project since I could learn a lot about IT as well as social skills and team leading insights.

        The conclusion of the first semester at RMIT University in 2022 has altered my perspective on both the course and my teammate. This project has assisted me in gaining new knowledge, such as Git, HTML, and CSS, while enhancing my social skills to work more effectively with my teammates. I have made new friends in this Intro to IT course, which has helped me improve my coding, since I had no prior experience. I cannot thank everyone sufficiently, particularly my teammate. Our leader, Trung, is a very strict pursuit of perfection who occasionally cracks humorous jokes. The fact that he has instructed us to be perfect at everything has helped us achieve high scores at RMIT. Other members, such as Hien and Nghi, have also helped me complete my task by imparting information that I would not have known otherwise. However, the most significant significance of the class is my group 37. Even though we were all freshmen and had only talked to each other for two months, we never had a disagreement or had a fight. The majority of the time we spent together offline and online was spent discussing ideas, making jokes, and assisting with the test. In conclusion, I am pleased with my teammate, our project, and the knowledge I have gained from this course.

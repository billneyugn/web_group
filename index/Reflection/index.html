    <p>The development of the group website and a prototype of our culinary recipe website. We created The Multiverse of Cooking apps with the intentions of keeping the authenticity of a dish.
    </p>
    <p>We collaborated effectively. We all recognized and capitalized on each other's strengths and weaknesses. The simplest thing we did was hand out directions and perform HTML while having fun identifying the food sources. Doing the CSS stuff was the most frustrating and discouraging thing. It was a pain in the throat because we had no prior experience with CSS. It took so long to understand the fundamentals that it took a full day.
    </p>
    <p>We had overlooked the assignment's complexities as a team. This leads to poor time management and the situation "We need more time!" The fact that not a single person on our team knows how to utilize Figma, the technology used to create our prototype food recipe website and mobile app has surprised and shocked us. But at the end we push through and we all get a good night's sleep.
    </p>
    <p>We could and must improve in a few areas in future initiatives. The first thing that needs to be improved is our communication. During the assignment, we did have regular meetings and sent many text messages. However, there were a few times when members missed important information, which led to a misunderstanding and wasted a lot of time. To fix this, Constance will make sure to inform members every hour on how the task is progressing. The second area for improvement is our understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and FIGMA because are lack of knowledge during the process of doing the project there are lots of setback for our team so in-order to grow is to not rushing into the task and spend more Time identifies the things we need to study.The third things for us to improve in the future is to look deeper, at the end of the project it is obvious that things are not going as smoothly as they would have we all let the fact that we work well together blinded us and now we are unhappy with our outcome. 
    </p>
    <p>Overall, this project not only brings us more knowledge and skills about coding and website but this project also makes us understand the importance of working in a team, a team is more than the sum of its individual members. Identifying and combining our contacts and abilities to create something more potent than any of us alone was essential to what we achieved.

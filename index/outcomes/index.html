      <div class="panel-content">The web is completed, but it is still in beta, thus there may be many faults with its operation. But it can operate the majority of the system and return results swiftly and efficiently. On the other hand, the app is a prototype in Figma so it cannot either do the searching for recipes nor login to account.

          <div class="panel-content"><p>We have limited knowledge of CSS and Figma, therefore we must make it run as effectively as possible while also making it visually appealing so that people will view it without providing negative feedback. We don't know how to draw either, therefore creating both website and app with Figma is quite difficult. However, we utilize simple yet efficient code, therefore we can confidently assert that the website will include few to no defects.

                    <h2>Topic:</h2>
                    <p>For group 37, we are doing a cooking recipe app to provide resources that are easy to use and can help people find recipes for many different things. With access to a vast collection of recipes from all over the world, they can either search for healthy, weight-controlling recipes or simply try something new, something unique. People can find the most suitable recipe for them by using the filters that are widely ranging from : country, time-consumption, ingredient,... We are also trying to provide a forum, social platform connected to the app so that our users can share their own recipes or their national dishes.People can also comment and make suggestion on other recipes, and we are trying to create an social media platform like Facebook, instagram, but only focus on cooking and (Concept of Idea)</p>
                    <p>In this project, we are aiming to help, provide and store recipes for all types of people, from professional chefs to armatures like homecooks and people who are just starting to cook. Only that, we want to be recognized and trusted whether people want to research traditional, national dishes from other countries or even their own country. We are also looking for diversity as people can come to our app whenever they need the simplest dish or even the most complicated one. Another of your future goal is to create an online community which only target in food and cooking, to let people have the ability to share their passion around others who has the same interest</p>
                    <h2>Motivation:</h2>
                    <p>Being Vietnameses, scrolling through recipe apps and seeing that our dishes are not being prepared correctly and properly, bugs us very much. The same situation happened for other countries for example like Japan, Korea, Greece, Peru,.. That leads us to the  urge of finding better solutions for people from all around the world to publish and store dishes from their countries as authentic as possible to preserve our culture and spread, promote it to the whole world. Another is to create a platform where there is only about culinary arts, where every material and content is at your fingertips. Those are the reasons for keeping the passion to develop this project.</p>
                    <h2>Landspace:</h2>
                    <p>After researching, we found out that this market is a competitive market with a lot of competitors that can be named such as: Tasty, Sidechef, Cooklist, Big Oven,... We are all similar to each other as we are all recipes providers. We are someone who can not compete with them as in the diversity and the amount of recipe but we can surely compete as in we are trying to provide a platform for only culinary related topics. Another point ís that we are trying our best to personalize the filter so that everyone can use the filter and can decide what they want to eat at ease.</p>

                    <p>We put our solution to the test by simulating a customer's experience. We will put some of our app's most significant features to the test, such as the login screen and the search section. We will try to sign up some new accounts for the login function and test if our app has received the user's new account or not, and then we will insert these accounts in the login screen. The test is successful if those accounts can simply access our app and use the internal features. On the other hand, because the search area is the most significant element of our product, we need to test it in a large number of cases to determine its effectiveness, thus we will ask roughly 50 people to test it. These test subjects could be our friends or family members. We anticipate that putting some ingredients into the search field will provide the test users with the desired recipes. Our test users' feedback will inform us what is currently missing in this functionality, and we will work to enhance it. Overall, if the test user's experience is positive, we have created an efficient method in our app.</p>

                <div class = "story">
                    <h3>1. Too many features:</h3>
                    <p>The first risk that we encountered is that we were too greedy and we want too many feature that we could not handle and it led to poorly developed feature.</p>
                    <p>So our solution was to settle a discussion to see which feature we really want to put into our project and really serve our motivation for this project.</p>
                    <h3>2. The feature is too difficult:</h3>
                    <p>We also encountered that some of our features need much more advanced skill and knowledge to develop.</p>
                    <p>We decided to keep it as an idea and put it aside so that whenever we are well prepared, we will get back to it and make it comtrue.</p>
                    <h3>3. Limited skills</h3>
                    <p>As freshmans, we have very little knowledge about building projects and we all have trouble with syntax errors when making a basic HTML page, which leads to an un-runnable website.</p>
                    <p>We traced back every line of code and asked for help from a senior who is capable of showing us the problem and helping us fix it.</p>
                    <h3>4. Competitors</h3>
                    <p>We have to face a lot of big and successful competitors in this market, which is the biggest disadvantage to us.</p>
                    <p>That is why we have to find a feature and focus in a feature that at least differentiate us from the majority of the competitors.</p>

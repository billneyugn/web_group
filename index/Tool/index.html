<br />
<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">
  <p>As freshmen, we found it a little bit hard to get used to the Git repository at first due to a lot of features and unfamiliar interface. It took us a while to get a hang of it and discover about the audit trail on the Git repository and it took us a little more time to realize the audit trait has great potential for reflecting ourselves.
</p>
<p>To our group, the audit trail on Git gave us a lot of insight in order to work better as a team. It could show and help us trace what we commit and how we change our code over time. It shows us we have problems dividing and breaking down our works. We tend to miss communicating and handle the same part of the project instead of different people doing different work. So it helps us realize it and fix it as soon as possible. And also it helps us to track our works and determine whether we are developing it in a logical order or not. So that we can follow and achieve our goal as easily as possible.
